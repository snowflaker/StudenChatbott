    "description": "This is the third course in the Teach English: Intermediate Grammar specialization. It will be useful to ESL teachers or those interested in learning to teach English language, but it is not an introduction to teaching course. You will learn about some specific problems students have learning intermediate grammar. You will learn why students have trouble with this tricky grammar and find out new ways to help students conquer it. You will also learn a variety of activities for teaching this content in a fun and interesting way. Finally, you will have opportunities to practice the skills you learn by creating sample assignments and recording short videos of your teaching demonstrations using a video camera, webcam, or smartphone. Learners wanting a grade will be required to submit short videos of their teaching skills.\\n\\nOnly learners who pay for the course will be able to take the graded quizzes or submit assignments for feedback.

    "description": "In this course we study the ancient, Socratic art of blowing up your beliefs as you go, to make sure they're built to last. We spend six weeks studying three Platonic dialogues - \\"Euthyphro\\", \\"Meno\\", \\"Republic\\" Book I - then two weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato: contemporary moral theory and moral psychology. \\n\\nPlatonic? Socratic? Socrates was the teacher, but he said he never did. Plato was the student who put words in his teacher's mouth. You'll get a feel for it.\\n\\nWe have a book: the new 4th edition of \\"Reason and Persuasion\\", by the instructor (and his wife, Belle Waring, the translator.) It contains the Plato you need, plus introductory material and in-depth, chapter-length commentaries. (Don't worry! John Holbo knows better than to read his book to the camera. The videos cover the same material, but the presentation is different.) \\n\\nThe book is offered free in PDF form - the whole thing, and individual chapter slices. It is also available in print and other e-editions. See the course content for links and information.\\n\\nThe course is suitable for beginning students of Plato and philosophy, but is intended to offer something to more advanced students as well. We seek new, odd angles on old, basic angles. Tricky! The strategy is to make a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach.  Lots of contemporary connections, to make the weird bits intuitive; plus plenty of ancient color, still bright after all these years. So: arguments and ideas, new possibilities, old stories, fun facts. Plus cartoons. \\n\\nThe results can get elaborate (some book chapters and some lesson videos run long.) But each video comes with a brief summary of its contents. The lessons progress. I put them in this order for reasons. But there's no reason you can't skip over and around to find whatever seems most interesting. There are any number of self-contained mini-courses contained in this 8-week course. You are welcome to them.\\n\\nPlato has meant different things to different people. He's got his own ideas, no doubt. (Also, his own Ideas.) But these have, over the centuries, been worn into crossing paths for other feet; been built up into new platforms for projecting other voices. (Plato did it to Socrates, so fair is fair.) So your learning outcome should be: arrival somewhere interesting, in your head, where you haven't been before. I wouldn't presume to dictate more exactly.",\

However, it is the common financial statements that contain important information that provides inputs for valuation of investment projects. The only challenge is how to properly extract them.\\n\\nAccounting and finance are indeed intertwined. Sometimes people that are not experienced in the area even mix them up. But most often emphasis in accounting is on numbers. Still, the deep understanding of key accounting concepts helps reveal the interests and actions of people behind these numbers. And the human dimension of accounting adds invaluable insight in the potential of successful project implementation.\\n\\nThis Course discusses core ideas and concepts of both financial and managerial accounting. It by no means pretends to be comprehensive to any extent. But, being rather an accounting overview, it focuses on the issues that are most relevant and important for effective valuation of investment projects.\\n\\nThe learners will gain insight into the essence of accounting.

    "description": "Kidney transplantation is a major advance of modern medicine which provides high-quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. What used to be an experimental, risky, and very limited treatment option more than 50 years ago is now routinely performed in many countries worldwide. The number of renal transplants is expected to rise sharply in the next decade since the proportion of patients with end stage renal disease is increasing. \\n\\nAre you interested in clinical kidney, pancreas and islet transplantation? If you are a (bio) medical student or a health care professional who works in the (pre) clinical transplant field this might be the course for you. This course is also for anyone interested in the research and knowledge on clinical transplantation. The course will be taught by a multidisciplinary team of transplant professionals and will give you the state of the art updates. \\n\\nIt is divided in 4 modules: \\n1) Before the transplant \\n2) The surgical procedures and the challenged patient, including the patient with diabetes \\n3) Early challenges \\n4) Late challenges after transplantation. \\n\\nThe offered modules will include lectures, interactive patient cases, 3D movies, interviews with well-known experts and with patients and a donor, a serious game to increase knowledge of the field and of course an active forum. Become an expert and join us!\\n\\nThe course is endorsed by The European Society of Organ Transplantation (ESOT), The International Society of Nephrology (ISN) and The Transplantation Society (TTS).\\n\\nThis MOOC has been accredited for Continuing Medical Education (CME). Health care professionals who works in the (pre) clinical transplant field, other health care professionals and general practitioners can obtain CME credit at 'LUMC-Boerhaave CME' upon passing the course. For more information we like to refer to the \\"Additional introduction for obtaining CME credit\\" module in week 1 of the course \\n\\nFor another interesting course on organ donation and transplantation, see Organ Donation: From Death to Life from Cape Town University https://www.coursera.org/learn/organ-donation",\

    "description": "How are international power relations changing and how can global peace and stability be maintained? This course familiarizes you with some main theories of international relations, shows how the global order is gradually changing and discusses how selected international and regional organizations contribute to the maintenance of global peace and security. You learn what research findings tell us in terms of the capacity of international organizations and actors to help prevent or stop violent conflict, what tools are used to negotiate agreements and how foundations for sustainable peace are best created. We will also focus on the role of the European Union in terms of diplomacy and efforts to prevent conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the contribution of organizations such as the African Union to the prevention of conflict and war. We will study the United Nations Security Council and see in which ways its membership could be adapted to more accurately reflect the power relations of the current global order. Through quizzes and exercises testing your knowledge of these subjects, you will understand crucial concepts and get insights into how the academic study of international relations and international organization contributes to the search for global stability and peace in practice.",\

    "description": "If you really care about the big questions in the economies and societies of the 21st century, such as distributive justice - namely, inequality of income or wealth, and its correlation with economic growth - this course is meant for you. The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.\\n\\n\\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -  Maximizing Social Wellbeing\\" is the second part of a two part course and it includes the following five lectures: \\n(1) The excess burden of taxation\\n(2) Tax incidence: who bears the economic burden of tax?\\n(3) Progressivity: definition and ways to achieve\\n(4) Low Income, Low Ability and the Optimal Income Tax Model\\n(5) Designing the Tax and Transfer System that Maximizes Social Wellbeing\\nIf you haven't done that already, we strongly recommend that you register for the first part of the course: \\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State\\". Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.\\n\\nThe course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths \'96 both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.\\n\\nThe course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:\\n\'95 Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;\\n\'95 Technology as the engine of economic growth;\\n\'95 Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?\\n\\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.\\n\\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:\\n\'95 better understand economic issues presented in the media\\n\'95 form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies\\n\'95 define and measure inequality and poverty\\n\'95 define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\\n\'95 explain the foundations of economic growth\\n\'95 design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals\\n\\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.\\n\\n\\nIn order to receive academic credit for this course you must successfully pass the academic exam on campus. For information on how to register for the academic exam \'96 https://tauonline.tau.ac.il/registration\\n\\nAdditionally, you can apply to certain degrees using the grades you received on the courses. Read more on this here \'96 \\nhttps://go.tau.ac.il/b.a/mooc-acceptance\\n\\nTeachers interested in teaching this course in their class rooms are invited to explore our Academic High school program here \'96 https://tauonline.tau.ac.il/online-highschool\\n\\nThis course is a direct extension of the first part \\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice Part I -The Role of the State\\", so if you have not yet taken it, we highly recommend you start your learning from there (https://www.coursera.org/learn/economic-growth-part-1/home/welcome).",\

    "description": "The purpose of this course is to summarize new directions in Chinese history and social science produced by the creation and analysis of big historical datasets based on newly opened Chinese archival holdings, and to organize this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.\\n\\nOur course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.\\n\\nPart 1 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-1) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions \'91Who rises to the top?\'92 and \'91Who gets what?\'92. \\n\\nPart 2 (this course) turns to an arguably even more important question \'91Who are we?\'92 as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction \'96 and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.\\n\\nCourse Overview video: https://youtu.be/dzUPRyJ4ETk",\

    "description": "Large-scale biology projects such as the sequencing of the human genome and gene expression surveys using RNA-seq, microarrays and other technologies have created a wealth of data for biologists. However, the challenge facing scientists is analyzing and even accessing these data to extract useful information pertaining to the system being studied. This course focuses on employing existing bioinformatic resources \'96 mainly web-based programs and databases \'96 to access the wealth of data to answer questions relevant to the average biologist, and is highly hands-on. \\n\\nTopics covered include multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, gene expression data analysis, and protein interaction networks, in two separate parts. \\n\\nThe first part, Bioinformatic Methods I (this one), deals with databases, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, selection analysis and metagenomics. \\n\\nThe second part, Bioinformatic Methods II, covers motif searching, protein-protein interactions, structural bioinformatics, gene expression data analysis, and cis-element predictions. \\n\\nThis pair of courses is useful to any student considering graduate school in the biological sciences, as well as students considering molecular medicine. Both provide an overview of the many different bioinformatic tools that are out there. \\n\\nThese courses are based on one taught at the University of Toronto to upper-level undergraduates who have some understanding of basic molecular biology. If you're not familiar with this, something like https://learn.saylor.org/course/bio101 might be helpful. No programming is required for this course. \\n\\nBioinformatic Methods I is regularly updated, and was last updated for January 2019.",\

    "description": "This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language \'93fits together\'94 to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.\\n\\nThis course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.\\n\\nThe course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.\\n\\nThe course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.\\n\\nWeek 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.",\

This study continues today, following the same chimpanzee families that Jane Goodall first encountered over 55 years ago. Guided by three course instructors who have lived and worked with the Gombe chimpanzees, you will learn how Goodall\'92s early discoveries changed our view of human uniqueness. By completing the course, you will gain a new appreciation of the deep similarities between chimpanzees and humans in intelligence, tool use, hunting, personality and social relationships, as well as some key differences. You will learn how chimpanzees interact with their environment and how their behavior is influenced by ecology, as well as the severe conservation challenges they face today. And you will employ your new knowledge of chimpanzees to construct a persuasive argument for their protection. This course is open to everyone interested in learning more about these fascinating and complex beings. Knowledge of high-school level biology is beneficial but not required. Please keep in mind, however, that the content of this course will cover all aspects of chimpanzee life, including scientific discussion of sexual and aggressive behaviors.",\

    "description": "Cada d\'eda es m\'e1s importante hablar bien en p\'fablico. \\nLa mejor oratoria es la que permite al orador conseguir los objetivos que se hab\'eda planteado. Contrariamente a la creencia com\'fan, la necesidad de una buena oratoria no es exclusiva de ciertos grupos profesionales, sino que todas las personas deber\'edan superar el miedo esc\'e9nico y hablar bien en p\'fablico. \'bfEl motivo? Poder trasladar de manera eficiente el mensaje deseado, ya sea para fines laborales (exponer proyectos laborales, convencer ante foros, asambleas o parlamentos, comunicar mejor con clientes, aumentar el grado de persuasi\'f3n), como personales (exponer proyectos personales, mejorar la comunicaci\'f3n con las personas). \\nEl orador se hace, no nace. \\nEn este curso adquirir\'e1s recursos para hablar bien y conseguir, a trav\'e9s de la palabra, los objetivos planteados. Te invitamos a descubrirlo con nosotros.",\

    "description": "Welcome to Course 2 - Sales Strategy - This course is designed to discuss the application of intelligence analysis in the sales planning process. And this approach contributes to integrating the sales planning process into the corporate strategy of the company because, in the strategy analysis and formulation process, we apply models, frameworks, tools, and techniques that also apply to the sales planning and management process. \\nTherefore, the expected outcomes of this course focus on the transition from traditional to strategic sales planning, by discussing and applying the concepts recommended to support the development of the strategic guidelines. \\nThe concepts, models, tools, and techniques discussed and practiced during the course focus on the improvement of value creation from the sales function empowered by intelligence analysis, a process which typically applies in the strategy analysis front. \\nThe discussions go through how intelligence analysis can support the sales function, by providing methods to connect strategy to marketing and sales planning processes. \\nIn this course, the primary learning outcome is the ability to apply intelligence analysis to support sales planning process, and by being able to do this, you\'92ll improve your competencies and skills to support sales planning with a strategic approach. \\nYou\'92ll develop a final assignment at the end of the course, and it is designed from an adapted real-life business case. The challenges of the case comprise the business context, through which you\'92ll apply the conceptual framework discussed during Course 2. \\nThe outcomes of your analysis on the assignment case will be evaluated through a peer-review process.",\

    "description": "You are encouraged to take the first four courses of the Foundations of Positive Psychology Specialization before starting this course and completing the Specialization Project. This course, taught by Dr. Martin E.P. Seligman brings all the key concepts from the first four courses to practice as you develop and test a new positive intervention for an audience of your choice. You identify opportunities in your daily life to increase the wellbeing by using knowledge you developed in the first four courses of the Specialization. In this final project, you evaluate the efficacy of a positive intervention based on subjective and objective measures. Then, you compare how empirical and non-empirically-based positive interventions can be applied to influence a person's wellbeing. Lastly, you reflect on how the fundamental elements of research methods are important in the everyday application of positive psychology.\\n\\nAfter completing all five courses, learners earn a certificate signed by Dr. Martin E.P. Seligman, Dr. James Pawelski, Dr. Angela Duckworth, Dr. Claire Robertson-Kraft and Dr. Karen Reivich.",\

    "description": "This course is multidisciplinary in nature, and aims to equip the global audience of interested lay people, people with chronic disease, public health researchers, health clinicians, students, administrators, and researchers to reflect on the overall impact of the burden of chronic disease . It shows how all chronic diseases (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer) are related by a set of common causes, and that such diseases should be tackled, not individually, but as part of a complex system, with interrelated contributing factors. These factors are genetic, environmental, psychological, economic, social, developmental, and media related. \\n\\nThe Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney is a unique interdisciplinary education and research hub which seeks solutions to chronic disease through a complex systems approach. Academics in many disciplines (in Science and Medicine, but also in Architecture, Humanities, Law etc)  work in a collaborative fashion to produce novel solutions to the problems of chronic disease.  All contributors and participants in this course are members of the Charles Perkins Centre and will  speak from the unique interdisciplinary perspective that this Centre affords. \\n\\nThe course will describe a complex systems approach as the most productive way to ease the burden of chronic disease. It then describes  these diseases in detail, their risk factors, and the environmental and biological factors that have led to the  current epidemic of  obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Finally, the solutions \'96 and more importantly the process for finding solutions- is the subject of the last module. No one approach by itself can ever be the answer, and certainly not a simple diet and exercise approach. \\n\\nThe entire course consists of 5 content modules, plus an extra module for completing assignments and discussions, and takes about 6 weeks to complete. Completion certificates are issued on the basis of participation in all 6 modules. \\n\\nWhat you'll learn: \\n-\\tHow the Charles Perkins Centre recruits interdisciplinary teams to ease the burden of chronic disease\\n-\\tHow a complex systems approach is necessary to provide solutions to a complex problem\\n-\\tThe fundamentals of chronic disease research and where it is heading\\n-\\tThe biggest risk factors for chronic disease and their global incidence\\n-\\tThe biological, genetic, social, regulatory, and other influences that have inflated these risk factors\\n-\\tHow to provide solutions globally for the reduction of chronic disease",\

This course is an invitation to let your inner songwriter step into the sunlight. All it takes is a simple \'93yes\'94 and you\'92ll be climbing that windy hill, marveling at the view.\\n\\nIf you haven\'92t written any or many songs, this course will show you an efficient, effective process for tailoring songs to express your ideas and emotions. If you have, you\'92ll look at your process differently, taking control of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.\\n\\nThe course will start by examining the tools available to you, all revolving around the essential concept of prosody. You\'92ll learn to use your tools to enhance your message\'97to work compositionally at the same time you\'92re developing your ideas.\\n\\nYou\'92ll be working both lyrically and musically, though musically it\'92s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument. If you play, great, and you\'92ll be encouraged to play and record your musical responses to the assignments. If you don\'92t play, the course offers you a number of musical loops to work with. All you\'92ll have to do is sing your melodies over the loops.\\n\\nAssignments will ask you to post something for peer review\'97sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing, not performing.\\n\\nMost important, you\'92ll have a lot of fun.",\

But all of us have tried to understand and predict behavior throughout our lives, first with our parents, then with our peers and teachers, and finally with our friends and co-workers.  The difference is that psychological scientists conduct research that discovers the facts about behavior and our minds, so its principles are based on science and not just on intuition and experience.  The course covers the fundamentals of learning, memory, motivation, emotion, and how behavior changes as we age.  The content of the course has received approval from \\"Quality Matters\\", an organization that evaluates on-line courses.  The learning outcomes are:  (1) Students will be able to recognize and describe major psychological principles of learning;  (2) Students will be able to distinguish between different types of memory;  (3) Students will be able to describe how motivation and emotion can affect how we behave; and (4) Students will know how cognitive behavior and social behavior develops as we age.",\

    "description": "This course follows the extraordinary development of Western Christianity from its early persecution under the Roman Empire in the third century to its global expansion with the Jesuits of the early modern world. We explore the dynamic and diverse character of a religion with an enormous cast characters. We will meet men and women who tell stories of faith as well as of violence, suppression, and division. Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Luther\'92s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.\\n \\nWe shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinas\'92 great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvin\'92s Geneva to Elizabeth\'92s England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.\\n \\nChristianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for God\'92s world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy. The course is a journey through the formation of the West as one strand of Christianity, as one chapter in a global story. It is a journey that has shaped our world.",\

How can we prove this?  In particular, we will examine a result that claimed that peptides harvested from a T. rex fossil closely matched peptides found in chickens. In particular, we will use methods from computational proteomics to ask how we could assess whether this result is valid or due to some form of contamination.\\n\\nFinally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to reconstruct an evolutionary tree of ebolaviruses and identify the source of the recent Ebola epidemic that caused global headlines.",\

    "description": "Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.\\n\\nThis course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.",\

The course will address five themes, each presented by an expert in the area. \\n\\n1. Science, Religion, and the Origin of the Universe (Professor Tim Maudlin, NYU )\\n2. Buddhism and Science (Professor Graham Priest, CUNY)\\n3. Evolution and Design (Dr Kevin Scharp, St Andrews)\\n4. Sin Suffering and Salvation: Evolutions Thorny Issues (Dr Bethany Sollereder, Oxford)\\n5. Human Uniqueness in Science, Theology, and Ethics (Professor David Clough, Chester)\\n\\nThe first and second courses in the Philosophy, Science and Religion series, 'Science and Philosophy' and 'Philosophy and Religion' were launched in 2017 and you can sign up to these at any time. It is not necessary to have completed these courses to follow this course. However, completing all three courses will give you a broader understanding of this fascinating topic. Look for: \\n\\n\'95 Philosophy, Science and Religion I: Science and Philosophy - https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy-science-religion-1\\n\'95 Philosophy, Science and Religion II: Philosophy and Religion - https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy-science-religion-2\\n\\nUpon successful completion of all three courses, students will:\\n\\n(1) Understand the main parameters at stake in the current debate between science and religion.\\n(2) Have some familiarity with the relevant areas of science that feature in the debate\'97including cosmology, evolution, and the neurosciences\'97and will have begun to engage with them conceptually.\\n(3) Have encountered key philosophical approaches to the interface between science and religion, and will have had the opportunity to engage them in practice.\\n(4) Have embarked constructively in cross-disciplinary conversations.\\n(5) Have demonstrated an openness to personal growth through a commitment to dialogue across intellectual and spiritual boundaries.\\n\\nYou can also follow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/EdiPhilOnline and you can follow the hashtag #psrmooc",\

    "description": "In their ambition to capture \'93real life,\'94 Japanese painters, poets, novelists and photographers of the nineteenth century collaborated in ways seldom explored by their European contemporaries. This course offers learners the chance to encounter and appreciate behavior, moral standards and some of the material conditions surrounding Japanese artists in the nineteenth century, in order to renew our assumptions about what artistic \'93realism\'94 is and what it meant.\\n\\nLearners will walk away with a clear understanding of how society and the individual were conceived of and represented in early modern Japan. Unlike contemporary western art forms, which acknowledge their common debt as \'93sister arts\'94 but remain divided by genre and discourse, Japanese visual and literary culture tended to combine, producing literary texts inspired by visual images, and visual images which would then be inscribed with poems and prose. Noticing and being able to interpret this indivisibility of visual/literary cultures is essential in understanding the social and psychological values embedded within the beauty of Japanese art.",\

Well there are some particular considerations for every data set and public health data sets have particular features that need special attention. In a word they are messy. Like the others in the series this is a hands on course giving you plenty of practice with R on real-life messy data with predicting who has diabetes from a set of patient characteristics as the worked example for this course. Additionally the interpretation of the outputs from the regression model can differ depending on the perspective that you take, and public health doesnot just take the perspective of an individual patient but must also consider the population angle. That said much of what is covered in this course is true for logistic regression when applied to any data set so you will be able to apply the principles of this course to logistic regression more broadly too. By the end of this course you will be able to explain when it is valid to use logistic regression and define odds and odds ratios and run simple and multiple logistic regression analyses in R and interpret the output ",\

This course begins with the discussion of these issues and global relationships and delves into a deeper understanding of business strategy in today\'92s global business marketplace.\\n\\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\\n\'95\\tUnderstand how we got here and why it matters\\n\'95\\tUnderstand the complexities of the current globalization (not all countries are the same)\\n\'95\\tEvaluate the effects of international trade regulations on international business\\n\'95\\tEvaluate when and why should we operate as multinationals\\n\\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

    "description": "Markets begins with one of the most common and important elements of the financial system \'96 interest rates.  You will learn why interest rates have always been a key barometer in determining the value of everything.  You will explore the changing influence of interest rates; the impact of interest rates on consumption, investment and economic growth; and the bizarre realities of negative interest rates. Markets explains how interest rates change the value of all financial instruments, highlighting the role of the bond and stock markets that have toppled empires.  We take a closer look at the equity pricing models and equity markets that reverberate across the globe, and explore everything from the first stock ever issued \'96 by the Dutch East India Company \'96 to the little-understood but powerful derivative securities market.  By the end of the course, you will have developed insight into the intersections of the financial markets with worlds of policy, politics, and power. You will have demonstrated that insight by teaching an important financial concept and translating a financial product or transaction to someone who will clearly benefit from your advice.",\

However, it is just beginning to impact public health.   This seminar is designed to introduce students to basic tools of theory building and data analysis in systems science and to apply those tools to better understand the obesity epidemic in human populations. There will also be a lab in which students will use a simple demonstration model of food acquisition behavior using agent-based modeling on standard (free) software (netlogo).   The central organizing idea of the course is to examine the obesity epidemic at a population level as an emergent properties of complex, nested systems, with attention to feedback processes, multilevel interactions, and the phenomenon of emergence.   While the emphasis will be on obesity, the goal will be to explore ways in which the systems approach can be applied to other non-communicable diseases both nationally and internationally.  \\n \\nTopics will include:\\na) the epidemiology of obesity across time and place,\\nb) theories to explain population obesity,\\nc) the role of environments and economic resources in obesity\\nc) basic concepts and tools of systems science,\\nd) modeling energy-balance related behaviors in context,\\ne) agent-based models, systems dynamic models, and social network models",\

What kind of risks need to be considered ? \\n\\nMountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. \\n\\nIn this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.\\n\\nThis particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, R\'e9publique et Canton de Gen\'e8ve, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.\\n\\nBy the end of this course, you will be able :\\n\\n- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions\\n- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies\\n- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions\\n- to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health \\n- to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.\\n\\nYour acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.\\n\\nThis MOOC on \'93Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concern\'94 was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences. \\n\\nWe look forward to you joining us !",\

    "description": "Experienced Computer Scientists analyze and solve computational problems at a level of abstraction that is beyond that of any particular programming language.  This two-part class is designed to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of \\"Algorithmic Thinking\\", allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to computational problems.\\n\\nIn part 2 of this course, we will study advanced algorithmic techniques such as divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming.  As the central part of the course, students will implement several algorithms in Python that incorporate these techniques and then use these algorithms to analyze two large real-world data sets.  The main focus of these tasks is to understand interaction between the algorithms and the structure of the data sets being analyzed by these algorithms.\\n\\nOnce students have completed this class, they will have both the mathematical and programming skills to analyze, design, and program solutions to a wide range of computational problems.  While this class will use Python as its vehicle of choice to practice Algorithmic Thinking, the concepts that you will learn in this class transcend any particular programming language.",\

    "description": "What is \'93progress\'94? How do we decide when we\'92re moving forward and not taking steps backward? And how do we explore the idea of progress around public sites of memory? This Teach-Out is an invitation to think about what progress means, and how you can look for it wherever you are\'97in your city, community, or neighborhood\'97and reflect upon your own ideas about the place you live in.\\n\\nChanges in the built environment of our communities are themselves the result of human actions and intentions, such as municipal planning, commercial enterprises, or communities transforming their own space. In other words, in our cities we can see the results of our plans\'97our attempts to create and shape the future. Neighbors, political groups, corporations, governments, schools, and other organizations, they all shape the community, leaving traces that allow us to see in what directions they transformed our lives. \\n\\nThis Teach-Out will ask the following questions:\\n\'95\\tWhat are the forces that shape and change the places we inhabit? \\n\'95\\tHow do people connect with places in our modern cities? \\n\'95\\tDo places progress? \\n\'95\\tHow can we measure in them whether there is any \'93progress\'94? \\n\\nWe will interview a number of people who work in Atlanta, Georgia, but the questions and places we will see here are comparable to many of other places in the world on what it means to progress. In this Teach-Out you will learn how to find the history of public spaces in any community and how to reflect upon the idea of progress. Finally, you can join a conversation to discuss what has been explored, uncovered, and possibly transformed both within ourselves and our communities.\\n\\nA Teach-Out is: \\n\'96 an event \'96 it takes place over a fixed, short period of time \\n\'96 an opportunity \'96 it is open for free participation to everyone around the world \\n\'96 a community \'96 it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals \\n\'96 a conversation \'96 an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people \\n\\nThis community learning event invites participants from around the world to come together in conversation with the Emory campus community, including faculty experts. This Teach-Out is part of Emory\'92s commitment to engage the local and global community in exploring and understanding problems, events, and phenomena most important to our society. \\n\\nOriginating from University of Michigan (Teach-Out.org), Teach-Outs are short learning experiences focused on a specific current issue. Attendees will come together over a few days not only to learn about a subject or event but also to gain skills. Teach-Outs are open to the world and are designed to bring together individuals with wide-ranging perspectives in respectful and deep conversation. These events are an opportunity for diverse learners and a multitude of experts to come together to ask questions of one another and explore new solutions to the pressing concerns of our global community. Come, join the conversation!",\

Perhaps, you have even taken Course 1, \\"Ruby on Rails: An Introduction\\" (we highly recommend it) where you relied on external web services to be your \'93data layer\'94. But in the back of your mind, you always knew that there would come a time when you would need to roll up your sleeves and learn SQL to be able to interact with your own relational database (RDBMS). But there is an easier way to get started with SQL using the Active Record Object/Relational (ORM) framework. In this course, we will be able to use the Ruby language and the Active Record ORM framework to automate interactions with the database to quickly build the application we want.\\n \\nIn Rails with Active Record and Action Pack, we will explore how to interact with relational databases by using Active Record, a Ruby gem, which Rails uses by default for database access. We will then take a look at what role Active Record plays in the overall request-response cycle, when a client (the browser) requests data from the server, as well as how to submit the data to the server.  Of course, when accessing data, security is of paramount importance! We will talk about vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, as well as how to secure access to data by authenticating and authorizing users accessing the data. Take this course to build a Ruby on Rails application with Active Record to automate the detailed SQL interactions with our database.",\

This course will give you a fundamental understanding of what ASD is, how it is diagnosed, the primary areas of impairment, and why prevalence is increasing. \\n\\nExamine the developmental and sensori-motor differences that may impact academic, play, social and self-help skills at different stages of life, including the transition to higher education and employment. Gain a clear understanding of how sensory regulation differs for individuals on the spectrum, and explore practical tools for identifying triggers and communicating feelings.  Learn to use evidence-based practices to provide effective interventions and explore typical strengths and weaknesses of individuals on the spectrum in relation to identified impairments. \\n\\nThe course culminates with a description of the ASD system of care, an overview of the National Standards Report studies and treatments, and an explanation of how evidence-based practices are established and implemented.\\n\\nThose seeking a more in-depth, instructor-led experience are encouraged to check out the Professional Concentration in Autism offered by UC Davis Extension: https://extension.ucdavis.edu/certificate-program/professional-concentration-autism-spectrum-disorders",\

Although there are other formal paradigms of the blues, such as 8-bar or 16-bar, this course focuses on different incarnations of the 12-bar blues. There are considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues, Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax, melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques. While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic and melodic syntax of jazz.\\n\\nThis seven-week course explores important aspects of the blues, blues improvisation, basic keyboard textures, jazz harmonic and melodic syntax. Topics include: (1) Blues Progressions; (2) Blues and Other Scales; (3) Improvisational Tools, and others. This course will also cover valuable theoretical concepts enabling the student to master the art of jazz improvisation. Each topic will be introduced from a practical perspective with the clearly stated goal: to improve one\'92s improvisational skills. Jazz improvisation is rooted in spontaneity, creativity, self-expression and, at the same time, self-control and order. A unique pedagogical approach based on a one-to-one musical interaction conducted with different instrumentalists will help to reinforce many of the concepts introduced in this course and realize its stated objectives.",\

The introduction of Smart urban technologies into legacy infrastructures has resulted in numerous challenges and opportunities for contemporary cities and will continue to do so. This course will help you to understand how to make the best of these smart technologies in your cities\'92 legacy infrastructures.  \\nOver the past few years, advances in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have significantly challenged the traditionally stable land scape of urban infrastructure service provision. This has resulted in increasing interest from both technology vendors and public authorities in the transition of cities towards so-called \'93Smart Cities\'94. Although such \'93Smart technologies\'94 can provide immense opportunities for citizens and service providers alike, the ICTs often act as disruptive innovators of urban infrastructure service provision.\\nIn this MOOC, you will gain a thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the Smart urban infrastructures, namely Smart urban transportation and Smart urban energy systems. Over the journey of this 5-week online course you will learn about the most important principles for the management of Smart urban infrastructures as well as the applications of these principles in the transportation and energy sectors. \\nThis course does not have any prerequisites. However, to take the most away from of this MOOC, we strongly encourage you to enroll in our other MOOC on the Management of Urban Infrastructures, which has been widely praised by learners. \\nThrough this course, you will:\\n- Gain a deep understanding of the nature of disruptive innovations (smart technologies) in urban infrastructure systems;\\n- Learn about state-of-the-art strategies for effectively managing the transition from legacy infrastructures to smart urban systems;\\n- Study the management of the transition phase from legacy infrastructure systems to smart cities by supporting innovations while avoiding early lock-in; and\\n- Understand potential applications of the materials learned in this course within the context of the management of smart urban transportation systems as well as smart urban energy systems.",\

    "description": "In this class, we will derive equilibrium outcomes across a variety of market structures. We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs when externalities are present. We will examine one key externality, pollution, and construct a policy prescription to mitigate the negative efficiency impacts of this externality.\\n\\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\\n\'95\\tExplain how different market structures result in different resource allocations.\\n\'95\\tModel the impact of external shocks to a particular market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after the impact of this external shock has played out.\\n\'95\\tEvaluate the efficiency of an equilibrium. Different market structures produce different levels of efficiency.  \\n\'95\\tExplain when and why the government might intervene with regulatory authority or antitrust litigation to lessen inefficiencies in some markets.\\n\'95\\tDescribe how information problems can cause inefficient outcomes.\\n\'95\\tUnderstand externalities and consider optimal government response to these market failures.\\n\\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

    "description": "This course teaches learners (industry professionals and students) the fundamental concepts of concurrent programming in the context of Java 8.   Concurrent programming enables developers to efficiently and correctly mediate the use of shared resources in parallel programs.  By the end of this course, you will learn how to use basic concurrency constructs in Java such as threads, locks, critical sections, atomic variables, isolation, actors, optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections, as well as their theoretical foundations (e.g., progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability).\\n\\nWhy take this course?\\n\\n\'95\\tIt is important for you to be aware of the theoretical foundations of concurrency to avoid common but subtle programming errors. \\n\'95\\tJava 8 has modernized many of the concurrency constructs since the early days of threads and locks.\\n\'95\\tDuring the course, you will have online access to the instructor and mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on the forums.\\n\'95\\tEach of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends.\\n\\nThe desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:\\n\\n\'95\\tConcurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability\\n\'95\\tUse of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java\\n\'95\\tAtomic variables and isolation\\n\'95\\tOptimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent  hashmaps)\\n\'95\\tActor model in Java\\n\\nMastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of concurrent Java programs, and will also help you master other concurrent programming system that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., POSIX threads, .NET threads).",\

    "description": "In previous courses in the Specialization, we have discussed how to sequence and compare genomes. This course will cover advanced topics in finding mutations lurking within DNA and proteins.\\n\\nIn the first half of the course, we would like to ask how an individual's genome differs from the \\"reference genome\\" of the species. Our goal is to take small fragments of DNA from the individual and \\"map\\" them to the reference genome.  We will see that the combinatorial pattern matching algorithms solving this problem are elegant and extremely efficient, requiring a surprisingly small amount of runtime and memory.\\n\\nIn the second half of the course, we will learn how to identify the function of a protein even if it has been bombarded by so many mutations compared to similar proteins with known functions that it has become barely recognizable.  This is the case, for example, in HIV studies, since the virus often mutates so quickly that researchers can struggle to study it.  The approach we will use is based on a powerful machine learning tool called a hidden Markov model.\\n\\nFinally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools applying hidden Markov models to compare a protein against a related family of proteins.",\

The University has 47 700 students and 7 500 staff based in Lund, Sweden. Lund University unites tradition with a modern, dynamic, and highly international profile. With eight different faculties and numerous research centers and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia's largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English. \\n\\nThe Faulty of Law is one of Lund University\'92s four original faculties, dating back to 1666. It is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty\'92s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university\'92s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\\nThe faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master\'92s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master\'92s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching. \\n\\nThe Master\'92s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.\\nThe MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master\'92s programme in European Business Law. Even though the MOOC course does not grant credits previous knowledge of the subject is considered upon admission to the master\'92s programme.

LMEs occupy areas of coastal ocean at least 200 000 km\'b2 or greater in size. These coastal waters produce 12.6 trillion USD in ecosystem goods and services annually and are vitally important for billions of people around the globe.\\n\\nBecause LMEs are bounded by ocean features and are globally linked, management of human activities needs to occur in an integrated fashion across political boundaries and economic sectors (e.g. fishing, shipping, energy, tourism, and mining.) This represents a new type of management approached - shifting from single sector-based to multi-sector assessment and management within the spatial domain of the world's 66 Large Marine Ecosystems. There is global high-level support for this new approach and in this course, we will introduce the concepts and tools for assessing and managing LMEs.\\n\\nTogether, leaders and experts in a global movement to recover and sustain the goods and services of LMEs will introduce you to the mechanisms used for assessment (Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis), planning and implementation (Strategic Action Programme). Based on recent activities in implementation and practice of the LME approach in 22 projects around the globe, we will showcase examples of effective management at this scale, and highlight the challenges and issues. By the end of the online course, we hope you will be able to actively use this knowledge to advance sustainable development of the world\'92s oceans.\\n\\nThe course was created with the support and input of: the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), UNESCO-IOC and IW:LEARN.",\

    "description": "Learn how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and how investors approach infrastructure investments! \\n\\nAccording to the OECD, the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.\\n\\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\\n\\nTraditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. \\n\\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. \\n\\nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\\n\\nIn the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.\\n\\nCourse Format\\nThe course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible to just focus on single topics.\\n\\nSuggested Readings\\nThe course is designed to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired outside of the course. \\nFor students interested in additional study material, you may refer to:\\n\'95\\tGatti Stefano, \\"Project Finance in theory and practice\\", Academic Press, 2nd edition, 2012.",\

It is about doing research, analyzing primary sources, and connecting all this information with a coherent and logical interpretation. It is an invitation to think critically and historically, and it wants to give you a glimpse of what it means to be a historian at work. \\n\\nWe are convinced that the three Roosevelts \'96 the 3Rs, as we will refer to them throughout this course \'96 profoundly shaped the twentieth century. This course shows you why we think so and which paradigms, ideas, and sources we use to uphold our claim. But this course also asks you to give your opinion, and ground it on your own research findings. \\n\\nThe structure of the course is straightforward: \\n- An introductory module gives you the biographical information you need to connect the personal stories of the 3Rs with the major events of the twentieth century;\\n-  Module 2 explains how the 3Rs reframed our thinking on security, broadening its meaning and reconfiguring the government\'92s role in providing it; \\n- Module 3, focusing on equality, shows how the 3Rs changed the relationship between leaders and led, rejected laissez-faire economics, and supported a politics of intervention to overcome the inequalities that undermined social cohesion;\\n- Module 4 describes how the 3Rs promoted and protected the freedom of ordinary citizens, and communicated that as one of their central political goals;\\n- Module 5 summarizes the long-lasting legacies of the 3Rs, and asks for your opinion on the Rooseveltian century. Do you agree with this interpretation of our recent past \'96 and our possible futures?\\n\\nThe five modules contain quizzes to test your knowledge and understanding, discussion prompts to stimulate your creativity, and research guidance and assignments to sharpen up your historical skills. \\n\\nWe hope you will enjoy this intellectual journey!",\

    "description": "In this course you will become familiar with the ideas of the water-energy-food nexus and transdisciplinary thinking.  \\n\\nYou will learn to see your community or country as a complex social-ecological system and to describe its water, energy and food metabolism in the form of a pattern, as well as to map the categories of social actors.  \\nWe will provide you with the tools to measure the nexus elements and to analyze them in a coherent way across scales and dimensions of analysis. In this way, your quantitative analysis will become useful for informed decision-making. You will be able to detect and quantify dependence on non-renewable resources and externalization of environmental problems to other societies and ecosystems (a popular \'91solution\'92 in the western world).  Practical case studies, from both developed and developing countries, will help you evaluate the state-of-play of a given community or country and to evaluate possible solutions. Last but not least, you will learn to see pressing social-ecological issues, such as energy poverty, water scarcity and inequity, from a radically different perspective, and to question everything you\'92ve been told so far.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\\nPart of the results and case studies presented have been developed within two projects: MAGIC and PARTICIPIA. However, the course does not reflect the views of the funding institutions or of the project partners as a whole, and the case studies were presented purely with an educational and illustrative purpose.",\

We may often use social media without thinking much about the possible consequences.   But there is a shadow side associated with social media use, which takes the form of hate speech, increased surveillance, lack of anonymity and questionable use of our data. What do we need to know to use social media spaces effectively, in a way that is safe and productive for all?\\n\\nThis course will guide you into a deeper exploration of online identity, social media communities and their users.  You will examine the ways that social media is being used by public institutions such as government to build participation and conversation with audiences.

    "description": "Why just write poems when you can write better ones? This course is built on the notion that the most exciting writing begins after the first draft. It is specifically for folks who believe that writing poems just to express oneself is like using the Internet just for email. After all, poetry can change the way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert of voices and music.\\n\\nThough any of us may have the potential to make that happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition can be used (and audaciously \'93mis-used\'94) gives you more ways to try (and if we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all). \\n\\nWe'll cover key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new poem drafts from a select number of prompts. Throughout the course you will have the opportunity to workshop your poem drafts and get feedback on your work, working towards a more polished poem.",\

In addition, you use it all day. A typical cellphone user touches their mobile phone 2,617 times a day (Dscout report based on 2017) and people spend over 4 hours a day on their mobile phones (Hackernoon report) on average. Smartphones and smart watches are very useful and will become even more useful due to their smaller sizes, lighter weights, versatile functionalities, advanced mobile communications & wireless networking (e.g., Wi-Fi & Bluetooth) technologies. In this course, the start-of-the-art smartphone and smart watch technology and components in addition to the global market trends and future forecasts are introduced. Since everybody uses smartphones and smart watches, knowing the details about the most globally used electronic device will definitely help you in all aspects of new product and app design & development, as well as business planning. In addition, the core technology and components of the world\'92s most popular smartphones (i.e., the Samsung Galaxy Note8 and Apple iPhone X) and smart watches (i.e., Samsung Gear S3 and the Apple Watch Series 3) are introduced along with details of the iOS and Android smartphone OSs (Operating Systems) and mobile communications 1G to 5G (for details on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, please take my course \'93IoT Wireless & Cloud Emerging Technology\'94).

It may be useful for professional psychologists, for specialists whose activity involves empathy, inspiration, understanding and creating of daily life, and for all who are interested in the topic. \\n\\nThe main idea of the course\\nGenius, talent and golden mediocrity are different (perpendicularly oriented) dimensions of human existence. They should be studied coherently with their manifestations. All together they construct a space for creative life, but each taken separately provokes traumatic, devastating and exhausting forms of anxieties. Our course shows how these three dimensions manifest themselves in life and how you can fulfill your genius, abilities, talents more fully and completely.\\n\\nOur Method\\nWe critically examine the manifestations of the studied \\"dimensions\\" (phenomena), in order that by putting off all \\"the supposed\\" we could find specific and inherent meaning. The phenomenological method is to understand and express in simple terms the fundamental structure of creative activity, to express everything that was, that is and that will be important in the psychology of creative life.\\n\\nCourse objective\\nOur main objective is a phenomenological description of genius, talent and golden mediocrity as specific dimensions of human life, correction of errors and misapprehensions of common sense regarding these phenomena.\\n\\nWhat you gain\\nAfter taking this course you will know what it is to be genius. You will see the phenomena of mediocrity and talent in a new light. You will understand these phenomena better based on our various examples.

Neuroscience, when allied with psychology and economics, creates powerful new models to explain why we make decisions. Neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making, decisions under risk, trust and cooperation will be central issues in this course. You will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, TMS, etc.) and introduced to the explanatory models behind them.\\n\\nThe course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience; however, it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials. The course provides an introduction to the methodology, assumptions, and main findings of  Neuroeconomics. Our students have different backgrounds; therefore, I have adapted and simplified the course to allow all students to understand the interdisciplinary content. This course will help you to start your progress in the field of Neuroeconomics and to further develop your skills during other more advanced courses and trainings in the future. For some topics, the course will also provide supplementary videos to reveal the opinions of leading experts in the field. Each module provides optional reading material.\\n\\nThe course structure is as follows: During each video, you will have to answer some relevant questions. Your answers will not affect your final grade. At the end of each module, you must complete a quiz consisting of 15 questions. To pass the course, you must reach a satisfactory standard in all the course modules by completing all graded quizzes and the final exam. In addition to watching video lectures and taking quizzes, you will receive an invitation to join our forum. We plan to join the discussions in the forum on a weekly basis.\\n\\nWelcome to Neuroeconomics World!",\

Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity. Weekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis of the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also be a peer reviewer.

R\'e9chauffement climatique, questions de d\'e9but et de fin de vie, \'e9volution vertigineuse des bio-technologies, in\'e9gale distribution des richesses, pressions migratoires accentu\'e9es\'85 La tentation est grande d\'92une vie morale repli\'e9e sur elle-m\'eame \'e0 partir d\'92une \'e9thique minimale\'a0: \'ab\'a0fais ce que tu veux, du moment que tu ne mets pas en p\'e9ril la libert\'e9 des autres\'a0\'bb. Nous proposons de prendre le contre-pied\'a0: d\'e9fendre l\'92id\'e9e d\'92une \'e9thique qui nous plonge dans notre r\'e9alit\'e9 sociale et politique, parmi nos semblables et avec eux. Et pour cela nous reposons la question de ce qui est juste, de ce qui est bien. Sans repartir de rien, sans tout r\'e9inventer.\\nC\'92est pourquoi nous pr\'e9sentons un cours qui permet de se familiariser avec les plus importantes perspectives \'e9thiques traversant le monde contemporain\'a0: l\'92\'e9thique des vertus (ou perfectionnisme)\'a0; l\'92\'e9thique du devoir (ou d\'e9ontologisme)\'a0; l\'92\'e9thique utilitariste (ou cons\'e9quentialisme)\'a0; l\'92\'e9thique de l\'92amour (ou \'e9thique du don). Ainsi chacun pourra mettre de l\'92ordre dans ses id\'e9es, rep\'e9rer les diff\'e9rentes mani\'e8res de s\'92orienter dans la vie morale, comprendre les diff\'e9rences d\'92appr\'e9ciation face aux diverses situations qui interpellent et sollicitent.\\n\\nQuels que soient votre champ de savoir acad\'e9mique, votre engagement professionnel ou vos choix personnels, il s\'92agit de proposer des cl\'e9s d\'92analyse dont vous disposerez. Pour cela, nous alternerons tout au long de ce cours les pr\'e9sentations des grands courants, sous leur forme ancienne puis contemporaine, et des questions plus transversales ou des cas concrets. Avec un seul but\'a0: clarifier les id\'e9es pour mieux comprendre le r\'e9el et mieux orienter l\'92action.\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\nAbout this course:\\n\\nThis course presents the main schools of thought that frame today\'92s ethical reflection and affect everyone in their personal, social and civic life. From Aristotle to Kant, from Bentham to Derrida, we will take you to the heart of contemporary ethical debates through a fascinating philosophical journey. Our increasingly complex world seems to elude our grasp. Global warming, beginning and end-of-life issues, the dizzying evolution of bio-technologies, the unequal distribution of wealth, heightened migratory pressures ... In response, we are tempted to make the moral life a self-legislating and isolated affair: \\"do what you want, as long as you do not put at risk the freedom of others\\". We propose to go against this trend and to defend the idea of \uc0\u8203 \u8203 an ethics that immerses us in our social and political reality, in and amongst our peers. We thus reformulate the question of what is right and what is good. This is not to say we are starting from scratch and reinventing the wheel. Rather, we will offer a course that allows you to encounter the most important ethical perspectives of our contemporary world: virtue ethics (or perfectionism); ethics of duty (or deontology); utilitarianism (or consequentialism); ethics of love (or ethics of the gift). Everyone will thus have a chance to evaluate his or her ideas, to identify different approaches to the moral life, and to understand a range of perspectives on different situations that face us in our lives. Whatever your field of academic knowledge, your professional commitments or personal choices, this course presents key concepts for further analysis. Therefore, we will alternate discussions of the founding schools of ethical thought, in their ancient and contemporary formulations, with cross-disciplinary issues and applied case studies. The goal throughout is to clarify ideas in order to better understand reality and orient human action.\\n\\n- - - - - - - - -- - - -- - - - - - - -- - - - - - -- \\n\u21892 \u12289 \u27491 \u20041 \u12289 \u21151 \u29992 \u65306 \u21746 \u23398 \u20262 \u29702 \u23398 \u23548 \u35770 \\n \\n\u26412 \u35838 \u31243 \u26088 \u22312 \u21521 \u22823 \u23478 \u20171 \u32461 \u20262 \u29702 \u23398 \u30340 \u20027 \u35201 \u27969 \u27966 \u65292 \u36825 \u20123 \u27969 \u27966 \u23545 \u22914 \u20170 \u30340 \u20262 \u29702 \u24605 \u32771 \u24847 \u20041 \u38750 \u20961 \u65292 \u24182 \u19988 \u28041 \u21450 \u21040 \u27599 \u20010 \u20154 \u30340 \u20010 \u20154 \u29983 \u27963 \u12289 \u31038 \u20250 \u29983 \u27963 \u21644 \u20844 \u27665 \u29983 \u27963 \u12290 \\n\u20174 \u20122 \u37324 \u22763 \u22810 \u24503 \u21040 \u24247 \u24503 \u65292 \u20174 \u36793 \u27777 \u21040 \u24503 \u37324 \u36798 \u65292 \u36890 \u36807 \u24341 \u20154 \u20837 \u32988 \u30340 \u21746 \u23398 \u20043 \u26053 \u65292 \u25105 \u20204 \u23558 \u36827 \u20837 \u24403 \u20195 \u20262 \u29702 \u23398 \u36777 \u35770 \u30340 \u26680 \u24515 \u38382 \u39064 \u12290 ",\

Most of us know that vocals serve as the focal point of modern recordings but many do not know the tools used or when the tools are used best in modern record production.\\n\\nThe course begins with simple vocal placement in a mix, where you will also learn the fundamentals of compression and equalization. You\'92ll further study delays and reverbs before moving to advanced concepts in audio editing, synthetic processing, automatic & graphic pitch correction, time compression, time expansion, flex and elastic audio. \\n\\nThrough analysis and/or hands on projects that the students will post for peer review, the student will gain an understanding of the many choices available to modern record producers as they record and mix with a modern tool set. You\'92ll see, in action, the Vocoder, Auto-Tune, Melodyne, Elastic Audio, Flex Time, VocAlign, tempo based editing and a host of other file modification protocols that are readily available on most Digital Audio Workstations. This course gives students a thorough look at the expanded choices that have risen in the art of vocal production as a result of these modern tools.\\n\\nThe goal of the course is to help interested novices understand the recordings they are listening to, performers find an expanded language for their recorded voices and for vocal producers to be able to create musically artistic visualizations using singers as their paintbrushes.",\

    "description": "This course is about how the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities.\\n\\nKnowing where things are is effortless.  But \'93under the hood,\'94 your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo \'96 these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain\'92s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain\'92s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.\\n\\nThe material in this course is based on a book I've written for a general audience.  The book is called \\"Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\\", and is available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press. \\n\\nThe course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.\\n\\nDr. Jennifer M. Groh, Ph.D.\\nProfessor\\nPsychology & Neuroscience; Neurobiology\\nDuke University\\n www.duke.edu/~jmgroh\\n\\nJennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain's spatial codes influence other aspects of cognition.  She is the author of a recent book entitled \\"Making Space:  How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\\" (Harvard University Press, fall 2014).\\n\\nMuch of her research concerns differences in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences hearing.  Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see.  These surprising findings challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain\'92s sensory pathways remain separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).\\n\\nDr. Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006.  She received her undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master\'92s, 1990), the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997).  Dr. Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception and memory for over fifteen years.  She is presently a faculty member at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University.  She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.\\n\\nDr. Groh\'92s research has been supported by a variety of sources including the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program, the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience, the John Merck Scholars Program, the EJLB Foundation, the Alfred P.

This example will let you understand and feel comfortable with some fundamental computer architecture terms as the instruction set, microprograms and microinstructions.\\n\\nAfter completing this course you will be able to:\\n\\n   * Design medium complexity digital systems.\\n   * Understand the description of digital systems using high-level languages such as VHDL.\\n   * Understand how computers operate at their most basic level (machine language).",\

We will start by introducing the complex plane, along with the algebra and geometry of complex numbers, and then we will make our way via differentiation, integration, complex dynamics, power series representation and Laurent series into territories at the edge of what is known today. Each module consists of five video lectures with embedded quizzes, followed by an electronically graded homework assignment.  Additionally, modules 1, 3, and 5 also contain a peer assessment. \\n \\nThe homework assignments will require time to think through and practice the concepts discussed in the lectures. In fact, a significant amount of your learning will happen while completing the homework assignments. These assignments are not meant to be completed quickly; rather you'll need paper and pen with you to work through the questions. In total, we expect that the course will take 6-12 hours of work per module, depending on your background.",\

While population health is largely produced outside of healthcare settings themselves, the functioning of healthcare, including diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness, injury, and other impairments, is essential for people\'92s wellbeing. Yet, healthcare can be and often is insufficiently accessible, responsive, and efficient for different members of society. How can healthcare provision and society be bridged?\\nThrough the exploration of a combination of theoretical and practical perspectives, this online course highlights the necessity of a dialogue and collaboration between healthcare professionals, patients, and the public at large. Course participants will critically explore challenges posed by disjunctures between healthcare and society, analyze both benefits and unintended consequences of bridging the two, and propose ways to accomplish the bridging in practice of healthcare provision.\\n\\nAfter completion of this course you will be able to:\\n\\n1.\\tRecognize disjunctures between healthcare provision and society\\n2.\\tBe aware of consequences of disjunctures between healthcare provision and society\\n3.\\tIdentify opportunities for bridging healthcare provision and society, using a biosocial approach to health\\n4.\\tAnalyze cases of disjunctures between healthcare provision and society, and propose opportunities for bridging\\n5.\\tRecognize the historical trends of scientification, professionalization, and medicalization, in the relations between medicine, health care, and society.\\n\\nThis course was developed by a consortium of five universities: Maastricht University, National Research Tomsk State University, National University of \\"Kyiv-Mohyla Academy\\",  National Pirogov Memorial Medical University, Vinnytsya, and Siberian State Medical University within the framework of BIHSENA project.

    "description": "This course teaches computer programming to those with little to no previous experience. It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today\'92s job market.\\n\\nNevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.\\n\\nStudents taking the course will get a MATLAB Online license free of charge for the duration of the course. The students are encouraged to consult the eBook that this course is based on. More information about these resources can be found on the Resources menu on the right.",\

Each module builds upon the previous one, so we strongly suggest you follow the sequence we've outlined rather than skip ahead or do the course in less time. The course is designed to give you an opportunity to learn and share with others, not test what you know. There are weekly activity and reflection assignments, but these will not be graded. To receive credit for this course, you will need to complete the peer-reviewed final assignment.\\n\\nAs a participant, you will:\\n- Watch videos that demonstrate natural phenomena and the Exploratorium's approach to teaching and learning \\n- Conduct personal investigations by engaging in hands-on activities based in those phenomena\\n- Reflect and share your experience doing activities\\n- Discuss and identify challenges and opportunities for teaching\\n- Devise a lesson of your own based on one or more of the activities\\n\\nEach week, we'll look at a different light-related topic: We will start by examining human visual perception, then take a brief historical tour of our evolving scientific understanding. We\'92ll also look at optics and optical instruments and finish by looking at the wave nature of light. \\n\\nTo get the most out of this experience, you'll have to try out some activities! In return, you'll get lots of valuable teaching resources, an in-depth understanding of the subject matter, and useful tips and techniques for the classroom.\\n\\nNOTE: This is a hands-on workshop, so you will need to buy or find materials.

That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday social world. So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy \'93us-them\'94 dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life. At the end of the course, you will start to see war everywhere and come to appreciate how much it defines our life.\\n\\nAll the features of this course are available for free.  It does not offer a certificate upon completion.",\

    "description": "Terrorism has arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and ordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly mean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by whom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage to scare us?\\n\\nThese are just a handful of questions that will be addressed in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. \\n\\nThe second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies. Since \'919/11\'92 terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But what has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or to debunk them as myths. \\n\\nThe final part looks into the implications and possibilities for policy making. The course ends with a module specifically designed to address one of today's most topical issue: the foreign fighter phenomenon.",\

    "description": "The objective of this course is to give students the most up-to-date information on the biological, personal, and societal relevance of sleep. Personal relevance is emphasized by the fact that the single best predictor of daytime performance is the quality of the previous night's sleep. The brain actively generates sleep, and the first section of the course is an overview of the neurobiological basis of sleep control. The course provides cellular-level understanding of how sleep deprivation, jet lag, and substances such as alcohol, ,caffeine, and nicotine alter sleep and wakefulness. The second section of the course covers sleep-dependent changes in physiology and sleep disorders medicine. Particular emphasis will be placed on disorders of excessive sleepiness, insomnia, and sleep-dependent changes in autonomic control. Chronic sleep deprivation impairs immune function and may promote obesity. Deaths due to all causes are most frequent between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m., and this second section of the class highlights the relevance of sleep for preventive medicine. The societal relevance of sleep will be considered in the final section of the class. In an increasingly complex and technologically oriented society, operator-error by one individual can have a disastrous negative impact on public health and safety.  Fatigue-related performance decrements are known to have contributed as causal factors to nuclear power plant failures, transportation disasters, and medical errors.",\

    "description": "The goal of this capstone spacecraft dynamics project is to employ the skills developed in the rigid body Kinematics, Kinetics and Control courses.  An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance. \\n\\nTasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated.\\n\\nTasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.  \\n\\nTasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.\\n\\nTasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet.",\

    "description": "This course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?\\n\\nThe course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate \'93how\'94 cell- level functions arise and \'93why\'94 mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.",\

    "description": "This course will cover the topic of  Whole genome sequencing (WGS)  of bacterial genomes which is becoming more and more relevant for the medical sector.  WGS technology and applications are high on international political agenda, as the classical methods are being replaced by WGS technology and therefore bioinformatic tools are extremely important for allowing the people working in this sector to be able to analyze the data and obtain results that can be interpreted and used for different purposes. The course will give the learners a basis to understand and be acquainted with WGS applications in surveillance of bacteria including species identification, typing and characterization of antimicrobial resistance and virulence traits as well as plasmid characterization. It will also give the opportunity to learners to learn about online tools and what they can be used for through demonstrations on how to use some of these tools and exercises to be solved by learners with use of freely available WGS analysis tools .\\n\\nBy the end of this course you should be able to:\\n\\n1. Describe the general Principles in typing of Bacteria \\n2. Give examples of the applications of Whole Genome Sequencing to Surveillance of bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance \\n3. Apply genomic tools for sub-typing and surveillance\\n4. Define the concept of Next-Generation Sequencing and describe the sequencing data from NGS\\n5.

    "description": "HI-FIVE (Health Informatics For Innovation, Value & Enrichment) Training is a 12-hour online course designed by Columbia University in 2016, with sponsorship from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC).  The training is role-based and uses case scenarios.  Also, it has additional, optional modules on other topics of interest or relevance.  Although we suggest to complete the course within a month's timeframe, the course is self-paced and so you can start and finish the course at anytime during a month's time period. No additional hardware or software are required for this course.\\n\\nOur nation\'92s healthcare system is changing at a rapid pace. Transformative health care delivery programs depend heavily on health information technology to improve and coordinate care, maintain patient registries, support patient engagement, develop and sustain data infrastructure necessary for multi-payer value-based payment, and enable analytical capacities to inform decision making and streamline reporting.  The accelerated pace of change from new and expanding technology will continue to be a challenge for preparing a skilled workforce so taking this training will help you to stay current in the dynamic landscape of health care.\\n\\nThis course is one of three related courses in the HI-FIVE training program, which has topics on population health, care coordination and interoperability, value-based care, healthcare data analytics, and patient-centered care.  Each of the three courses is designed from a different perspective based on various healthcare roles.  This first course is from a clinical perspective, geared towards physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, clinical executives and managers, medical assistants, and other clinical support roles.  However, we encourage anyone working in healthcare, health IT, public health, and population health to participate in any of the three trainings. \\n\\nIf you would like to obtain continuing medical education (CME) or continuing nursing education (CNE) credits, you will need to have eligible credentials, complete the entire course, and complete the evaluation survey at the end.  The HI-FIVE team verifies after each month that these requirements have been met and then a separate certificate (fee may apply) is distributed to you from our accreditation office.  Please allow time for processing.  If you have any further questions about continuing education, please see our website at www.hi-fivetraining.org. \\n\\nAccreditation Statement\\nThe College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\\n\\nAMA Credit Designation Statement\\nThe College of Physcians and Surgeons designates this enduring material for 12.0 AMA PRA Category 1 Credits\'99. Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\\n\\nThe planning committee members are: Rita Kukafka, DrPH, MA, FACMI; Bruce Forman, MD; Gil Kuperman, MD, PhD; Virginia Lorenzi, MS, CPHIMS, FHL7, and Victoria Tiase, MSN, BN.

Adopted by 193 member states, the goals represent an important international step in setting humanity on a trajectory towards sustainable development. Within this course, you will get a historical overview of how sustainability has been understood, as well as a thorough introduction to the SDGs \'96 what they are, how progress can be measured, and how the SDGs are relevant for the management of the global systems supporting humanity. The course will examine how various societal actors are responding to and implementing the SDGs. \\n\\nWhile all of the SDGs are essential to sustainable development, SDG 13, Climate Action, is usually perceived as the most urgent in terms of the need for a swift implementation on a global scale. Therefore, particular focus is given to this SDG. Through the course, you will gain up-to-date knowledge of the current understanding of human impacts on the Earth at the planetary level. Progress towards establishing global management of human interactions with the climate system within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is also discussed.\\n\\nThe course is designed and taught by Professor Katherine Richardson, who is a member of the 15-person panel appointed by the UN General Secretary in 2016 to write the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report. In each lecture, Katherine interviews experts who provide insights relevant to the topic at hand.",\

    "description": "Welcome to Asymmetric Cryptography and Key Management! \\n\\nIn asymmetric cryptography or public-key cryptography, the sender and the receiver use a pair of public-private keys, as opposed to the same symmetric key, and therefore their cryptographic operations are asymmetric. This course will first review the principles of asymmetric cryptography and describe how the use of the pair of keys can provide different security properties. Then, we will study the popular asymmetric schemes in the RSA cipher algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol and learn how and why they work to secure communications/access. Lastly, we will discuss the key distribution and management for both symmetric keys and public keys and describe the important concepts in public-key distribution such as public-key authority, digital certificate, and public-key infrastructure. This course also describes some mathematical concepts, e.g., prime factorization and discrete logarithm, which become the bases for the security of asymmetric primitives, and working knowledge of discrete mathematics will be helpful for taking this course; the Symmetric Cryptography course (recommended to be taken before this course) also discusses modulo arithmetic.\\n\\nThis course is cross-listed and is a part of the two specializations, the Applied Cryptography specialization and the Introduction to Applied Cryptography specialization.",\

Why does Verizon charge $15 for every GB of data we use? Is it really true that we are connected in six social steps or less?\\n\\nThese are just a few of the many intriguing questions we can ask about the social and technical networks that form integral parts of our daily lives. This course is about exploring the answers, using a language that anyone can understand. We will focus on fundamental principles like \'93sharing is hard\'94, \'93crowds are wise\'94, and \'93network of networks\'94 that have guided the design and sustainability of today\'92s networks, and summarize the theories behind everything from the social connections we make on platforms like Facebook to the technology upon which these websites run.\\n\\nUnlike other networking courses, the mathematics included here are no more complicated than adding and multiplying numbers. While mathematical details are necessary to fully specify the algorithms and systems we investigate, they are not required to understand the main ideas. We use illustrations, analogies, and anecdotes about networks as pedagogical tools in lieu of detailed equations.\\n\\nAll the features of this course are available for free.

    "description": "This course evaluates the medieval history of Toledo from the era of the Visigoth Kingdom (6th-8th centuries) through its Islamic period (8th to 11th centuries) and into its reintegration into Christian Spain (after 1085 c.e.) In particular, we take note of the cultural and religious transformations that characterized the city with a special effort to understand how many peoples and religions came to settle and live amongst one another. We will virtually-tour the Islamic and Christian structures of the Museo de Santa Cruz, Iglesia de San Rom\'e1n, Sinagoga del Tr\'e1nsito, Mezquita de Bab al-Mardum, Archivo Municipal de Toledo, and the Archivo Historico de la Nobleza.\\n\\nWe examine the Visigoths transition from Christian Arianism to Catholicism and the harsh treatment of the Jewish population. We explore Islamic governance and development of the medieval city of three faiths, with a special interest in its cultural achievements. We will study King Alfonso \'93The Wise\'94 (1252-1284)\'92s efforts to characterize himself as the \'93king of three religions\'94 via his legal codices, the creation of the Cantigas de Santa Mar\'eda, and his intellectual endeavor known as the Toledo School of Translators. We evaluate the robust Jewish and converso noble families of the city and appreciate their intellectual, religious, and economic contributions to Castilian life. We will bear witness to the rise of anti-Jewish blood purity statutes, the creation of the Inquisition, and the expulsion of the Jews. We also briefly introduce and study Spanish manuscripts from the municipal and cathedral archives to make new scholarly breakthroughs relating to the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim interrelations.\\n\\nNo knowledge of Spanish is needed to participate in the course or in our transcription efforts.",\

    "description": "In this course, you will learn the science behind how digital images and video are made, altered, stored, and used. We will look at the vast world of digital imaging, from how computers and digital cameras form images to how digital special effects are used in Hollywood movies to how the Mars Rover was able to send photographs across millions of miles of space.\\n \\nThe course starts by looking at how the human visual system works and then teaches you about the engineering, mathematics, and computer science that makes digital images work. You will learn the basic algorithms used for adjusting images, explore JPEG and MPEG standards for encoding and compressing video images, and go on to learn about image segmentation, noise removal and filtering. Finally, we will end with image processing techniques used in medicine.\\n \\nThis course consists of 7 basic modules and 2 bonus (non-graded) modules. There are optional MATLAB exercises; learners will have access to MATLAB Online for the course duration. Each module is independent, so you can follow your interests.",\

Consequently, they are bound to hire more and more spatial data scientists.  Based on such business trend, this course is designed to present a firm understanding of spatial data science to the learners, who would have a basic knowledge of data science and data analysis, and eventually to make their expertise differentiated from other nominal data scientists and data analysts.  Additionally, this course could make learners realize the value of spatial big data and the power of open source software's to deal with spatial data science problems.\\n\\nThis course will start with defining spatial data science and answering why spatial is special from three different perspectives - business, technology, and data in the first week.  In the second week, four disciplines related to spatial data science - GIS, DBMS, Data Analytics, and Big Data Systems, and the related open source software's - QGIS, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, R, and Hadoop tools are introduced together.  During the third, fourth, and fifth weeks, you will learn the four disciplines one by one from the principle to applications.  In the final week, five real world problems and the corresponding solutions are presented with step-by-step procedures in environment of open source software's.",\

    "description": "For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing educational priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining and learning analytics systems in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by \'91big data\'92 including data persistency and student profiling.",\

    "description": "Discrete Optimization aims to make good decisions when we have many possibilities to choose from. Its applications are ubiquitous throughout our society. Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions on the use of scarce or expensive resources such as staffing and material resources also allow corporations to improve their profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.\\n\\nThis course is intended for students who have completed Advanced Modelling for Discrete Optimization.  In this course, you will extend your understanding of how to solve challenging discrete optimization problems by learning more about the solving technologies that are used to solve them, and how a high-level model (written in MiniZinc) is transformed into a form that is executable by these underlying solvers. By better understanding the actual solving technology, you will both improve your modeling capabilities, and be able to choose the most appropriate solving technology to use.\\n\\nWatch the course promotional video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EiRsK-Rm08",\

    "description": "This course provides an analytical framework to help you evaluate key problems in a structured fashion and will equip you with tools to better manage the uncertainties that pervade and complicate business processes. The course aim to cover statistical ideas that apply to managers. We will consider two basic themes: first, is recognizing and describing variations present in everything around us, and then modeling and making decisions in the presence of these variations. The fundamental concepts studied in this course will reappear in many other classes and business settings. Our focus will be on  interpreting the meaning of the results in a business and managerial setting.\\n\\nWhile you will be introduced to some of the science of what is being taught, the focus will be on applying the methodologies.  This will be accomplished through use of Excel and using data sets from many different disciplines, allowing you to see the use of statistics in very diverse settings. The course will focus not only on explaining these concepts but also understanding the meaning of the results obtained.\\n\\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\\n\'95\\tTest for beliefs about a population..\\n\'95\\tCompare differences between populations.\\n\'95\\tUse linear regression model for prediction. \\n\'95\\tLearn how to use Excel for statistical analysis.\\n\\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

    "description": "Businesses run on data, and data offers little value without analytics. The ability to process data to make predictions about the behavior of individuals or markets, to diagnose systems or situations, or to prescribe actions for people or processes drives business today. Increasingly many businesses are striving to become \'93data-driven\'94, proactively relying more on cold hard information and sophisticated algorithms than upon the gut instinct or slow reactions of humans. \\n\\nThis course will focus on understanding key analytics concepts and the breadth of analytic possibilities. Together, the class will explore dozens of real-world analytics problems and solutions across most major industries and business functions. The course will also touch on analytic technologies, architectures, and roles from business intelligence to data science, and from data warehouses to data lakes. And the course will wrap up with a discussion of analytics trends and futures.",\

This course will teach you how to make emotionally moving recordings on almost any recording equipment, including your phone or laptop. The emphasis is on mastering tangible artistic concepts; the gear you use is up to you. You will learn to develop the most important tool in the recording studio: your ears. You will learn to enhance every aspect of your own productions, both sonically and musically, by employing deeper listening skills. \\n\\nAssignments will include posting your own recordings for peer review, and reviewing your classmates\'92 work by employing specific tools and strategies. If you use a digital audio workstation to record and mix, that\'92s great, but as long as you can record into your computer and post an MP3, you can complete the assignments. \\n\\nAs you learn about the art of record production in this 4-week course, you will also learn about yourself and who you are as an artist and producer.

This course aims to bridge the gap between the fundamental principles taught in electromagnetism and its practical application to specific fields such as materials, physics, and chemistry related to energy storage and harvesting. \\n\\nThe goal of Electrodynamics: An Introduction is to not only teach electromagnetism but also introduce some mathematical tools which can be used to solve problems in the subject.  Within these lecture notes, we review vector calculus and explain how to use fields to visualize the topics we cover.  This course is dynamic, as the lectures continuously build on previous notes and a variety of explanations are presented for each solution.  Since this is a lower level course, we will focus on the simple concept of electrostatics.  This has applications in exploring intermolecular forces, and qualities of capacitors.  Through this, we relate electromagnetism to more conventionally studied topics and its application to specific research topics related to energy storage and harvesting.",\

Scala fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with both Java and Javascript. Scala is the implementation language of many important frameworks, including Apache Spark, Kafka, and Akka. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, Tumblr and also Coursera.\\n\\nIn this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically.\\n\\nThe course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series programming projects as homework assignments.\\n\\nRecommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line.",\

    "description": "Colossal pyramids, imposing temples, golden treasures, enigmatic hieroglyphs, powerful pharaohs, strange gods, and mysterious mummies are features of Ancient Egyptian culture that have fascinated people over the millennia.  The Bible refers to its gods, rulers, and pyramids. Neighboring cultures in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean wrote about its god-like kings and its seemingly endless supply of gold.  The Greeks and Romans describe aspects of Egypt's culture and history.\\n\\nAs the 19th century began, the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt highlighted the wonders of this ancient land, and public interest soared.  Not long after, Champollion deciphered Egypt's hieroglyphs and paved the way for other scholars to reveal that Egyptian texts dealt with medicine, dentistry, veterinary practices, mathematics, literature, and accounting, and many other topics. Then, early in the 20th century, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and its fabulous contents. Exhibitions of this treasure a few decades later resulted in the world's first blockbuster, and its revival in the 21st century has kept interest alive.\\n\\nJoin Dr. David Silverman, Professor of Egyptology at Penn, Curator in Charge of the Egyptian Section of the Penn Museum, and curator of the Tutankhamun exhibitions  on a guided tour of the mysteries and wonders of this ancient land.  He has developed this online course and set it in the galleries of the world famous Penn Museum.  He uses many original Egyptian artifacts to illustrate his lectures as he guides students as they make their own discovery of this fascinating culture.",\

They are equipped to identify some key application areas of computer vision and understand the digital imaging process. The course covers crucial elements that enable computer vision: digital signal processing, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Topics include color, light and image formation; early, mid- and high-level vision; and mathematics essential for computer vision. Learners will be able to apply mathematical techniques to complete computer vision tasks. \\n\\nThis course is ideal for anyone curious about or interested in exploring the concepts of computer vision. It is also useful for those who desire a refresher course in mathematical concepts of computer vision. Learners should have basic programming skills and experience (understanding of for loops, if/else statements), specifically in MATLAB (Mathworks provides the basics here: https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html). Learners should also be familiar with the following: basic linear algebra (matrix vector operations and notation), 3D co-ordinate systems and transformations, basic calculus (derivatives and integration) and basic probability (random variables).  \\n\\nMaterial includes online lectures, videos, demos, hands-on exercises, project work, readings and discussions. Learners gain experience writing computer vision programs through online labs using MATLAB* and supporting toolboxes.\\n\\nThis is the first course in the Computer Vision specialization that lays the groundwork necessary for designing sophisticated vision applications.

    "description": "This course is all about matrices, and concisely covers the linear algebra that an engineer should know.   We define matrices and how to add and multiply them, and introduce some special types of matrices.  We describe the Gaussian elimination algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations and the corresponding LU decomposition of a matrix.    We explain the concept of vector spaces and define the main vocabulary of linear algebra.  We develop the theory of determinants and use it to solve the eigenvalue problem.\\n\\nAfter each video, there are problems to solve and  I have tried to choose problems that exemplify the main idea of the lecture.  I try to give enough problems for students to solidify their understanding of the material, but not so many  that students feel overwhelmed and drop out.   I do encourage students to attempt the  given problems,  but if they get stuck, full solutions can be found in the lecture notes for the course.  \\n\\nThe mathematics in this matrix algebra course is  presented at the level of an advanced  high school student, but typically students would take this course after completing a university-level single variable calculus course.  There are no derivatives or integrals in this course, but student's are expected to have a certain level of mathematical maturity.  Nevertheless, anyone who wants to learn the basics of matrix  algebra is welcome to join.  \\n\\nLecture notes may be downloaded at \\nhttps://bookboon.com/en/matrix-algebra-for-engineers-ebook\\nor\\nhttp://www.math.ust.hk/~machas/matrix-algebra-for-engineers.pdf\\n\\nWatch the course overview video at\\nhttps://youtu.be/IZcyZHomFQc",\

This course illustrates the principles of public health applied to depressive disorder, including principles of epidemiology, transcultural psychiatry, health services research, and prevention. It is predicted that by 2020 depressive disorder will be the most important cause of disease burden in the entire world! Every human being suffers from feeling depressed at some point or other, but only about one fifth of the population will experience an episode of depressive disorder over the course of their lives. This course illuminates the public health approach to disease, and the particular complexities of applying this approach to mental disorders, using depression as the exemplar.",\

If you were just admitted to college and are nervous about what the next step in life might look like, this course is for you. If you are the parent of a newly admitted college student and curious about what college life is like, this course is also for you. \\n\\nWhile your specific college will, no doubt, provide additional orientation material, we wanted to give some basic information about what life might be like at a large American University. You might be years away from college or enrolled right now; either way, U101 has some excellent advice from college students, professors, administrators, and staff.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the course, learners should:\\n1. Understand the basics of how colleges and universities operate. \\n2. Identify and describe what faculty are looking for in college-level academic work. \\n3. List some effective study strategies. \\n4. Identify some strategies for exploring and selecting a major. \\n5. Identify the various types of grants and scholarships available and describe the steps involved in applying to these.\\n6. Discuss the college life, with special attention to the benefits/limitations of living on or off campus. \\n7. Identify some strategies for getting the most out of campus life activities (investigating student clubs, fraternities, sororities, etc.).\\n\\nThe course is divided into 4 weeks/8 lessons, which provide an overview of the different aspects of college life. If you were just watching the videos and looking at some of the links, the whole course would take about 4-5 hours. \\n\\nWeek 1\\nLesson 1. Welcome to U101!\\nLesson 2. Understanding the Nature of College\\n\\nWeek 2\\nLesson 3. Succeeding as a Student\\nLesson 4. Building Your Major\\n\\nWeek 3\\nLesson 5. Financing Your Education\\nLesson 6. Living On and Off Campus\\n\\nWeek 4\\nLesson 7. Getting Involved in Campus Life\\nLesson 8. Conclusion\\n\\nPlease join us for a short exploration of modern American Colleges. Hopefully, this course can help demystify your upcoming college experience.",\

While there are different approaches to defining a branding strategy, a branding project\'92s implementation impacts many departments and their customer-facing activities. In this sense, it\'92s essential to understand branding efforts in the context of Customer Experience. In this course, we will use a framework - adapted from Customer Journey Mapping - for focusing and organizing students' thinking about the operational implications of their branding projects.

    "description": "Amazon famously delivers new code every 11.6 seconds. Just a few years ago, this was unthinkable: many \'91cutting edge\'92 firms would release software quarterly. When it comes to digital innovation, velocity is critical and many would say it\'92s the most reliable determinant of success. \\n\\nBringing an organization to the state of the art (or even functional capability) in this area requires strong work in a combination of disciplines and a combination of both technical and managerial skills. There is no single cookie-cutter approach for achieving this capability. Much like agile, the right focus and formulation depends a lot on the facts and circumstances of the team. This course will provide you with the interdisciplinary skill set to cultivate a continuous deployment capability in your organization. \\n\\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to: \\n1. Diagnose a team\'92s delivery pipeline and bring forward prioritized recommendations to improve it\\n2. Explain the skill sets and roles involved in DevOps and how they contribute toward a continuous delivery capability\\n3. Review and deliver automation tests across the development stack\\n4. Explain the key jobs of system operations and how today\'92s leading techniques and tools apply to them\\n5. Explain how high-functioning teams use DevOps  and related methods to reach a continuous delivery capability \\n6. Facilitate prioritized, iterative team progress on improving a delivery pipeline",\

You'll learn to do both of these in this course!\\n\\nThis class teaches the concepts of nested if/else statements and compound Boolean conditional expressions.  For each concept, we'll start by helping you connect real-world experiences you are already familiar with to the programming concept you are about to learn.  Next, through a cognitively scaffolded process we'll engage you in developing your fluency with problem solving with nested if/else statements and compound conditionals in a way that keeps frustration at a minimum.  \\n\\nAlong the way you will learn about the common challenges or \\"bugs\\" students have with these concepts as well as ways to help them find and fix those concepts.  You'll also be guided in running classroom discussions to help students develop deeper understanding of these concepts.\\n\\nFinally, you'll prepare classroom resources to help your students to develop debugging skills.  Additionally, you will create resources to help educate your students about the impacts of lack of equity in K-12 CS instruction.",\

    "description": "You should complete the VLSI CAD Part I: Logic course before beginning this course.\\n\\nA modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called \'93intellectual property\'94 or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus in this part of the course is on the key logical and geometric representations that make it possible to map from logic to layout, and in particular, to place, route, and evaluate the timing of large logic networks. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: technology mapping, timing analysis, and ASIC placement and routing.\\n\\nRecommended Background:\\nProgramming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.  Elementary knowledge of RC linear circuits (at the level of an introductory physics class).",\

In this six-part course we explore the anatomy and physiology underlying the vital signs so that you will develop a systematic, integrated understanding of how the body functions. Relevant body systems are reviewed including cardiovascular and respiratory, followed by explanations of how the function of these systems affects vital signs. We discuss normal ranges, normal variants, and the mechanisms that underlie changes in the objective measurement of vital signs. The course also includes demonstrations of appropriate techniques for measuring vital signs in yourself and others.\\n\\nThe course is designed for a broad, general audience but will be particularly interesting for individuals working in healthcare, those considering a career as a healthcare professional, lay caregivers, those with an interest in personal health and fitness, or anyone who simply wants to understand how the body functions.",\

The focus will be on the moments of paradigm shift from one mode of rationality to another. For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts\'97thought, literature, ritual\'97will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems.\\n\\nThe first two courses will cover the periods of the Warring States (481-256 BCE) and the Period of Division (220-589 CE), with a brief excursion into the Han (206 BCE-220 CE). The Warring States laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the Period of Division saw the Buddhist \'93conquest\'94 of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.\\n\\nThe third and fourth courses will focus on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today\'92s China 1850 to the present. We will see how the modern attack on religion, redefined as \\"superstition\\", led not only to religious reform movements but also to a society in which science and the nation became the primary value systems promoted by the state.\\n\\nThe courses are listed below:\\n\\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Early China I: Intellectual Change in the Warring States and Han (481 BCE-220 CE)\\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Early China II: Religious Transformation in the Period of Division (220-589 CE) \\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China I: Religion and Thought in the Song, Jin, and Yuan (960-1368) (To be launched in late 2018)\\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China II: Structuring Values (1850-2015) (To be launched in late 2018)",\

Each year, this pollution costs 7 million lives across the globe \'96 and a lot of suffering. 1 in 8 deaths is due to air pollution. This course will provide you with an introduction to the most recent research in the field of health effects of air pollution as well as a broader understanding of sources and spread of air pollution and what we should do about it.\\n \\nWhat is air pollution? What are the sources? How and where are we exposed outdoors and indoors? What happens in the body? Which diseases are the result? Who are the most vulnerable? How can we assess the effects of air pollution? And what should we do to reach the Sustainable Development Goal to \'93substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution\'94? These are some of the important questions we will address in the course.\\n\\nDuring the course you will meet researchers and experts from the University of Copenhagen and the Technical University of Denmark. They work with different aspects of air pollution and health: toxicology, exposure assessment, epidemiology, engineering and health impact assessment. It is a global responsibility to combat the health impacts of air pollution, and this fight can only be won through new knowledge and global collaboration. \\n\\nWe hope you will join us in the course and equip yourself to take part in this global and individual health challenge.",\

    "description": "Learn how to identify the enablers and barriers to learning transfer. Use your own experience to categorise the processes and activities involved in learning and transferring that learning into practice. There are many criteria against which the success of training and development activities can be judged. One of the most important, however, is learning transfer. Ultimately, the success of any given training and/or development program is reflected in whether or not what is learned is applied on the job. Organisations - and indeed trainees themselves - invest large amounts of time, effort, and resources in work-related training and generally expect to see this manifested in some way back in the work setting (e.g. as observable changes to how work is conducted). However, many organisations and their people view the likelihood of transfer of training more in hope than expectation. This course will show you how to approach the goal of improving learning transfer in your organisation.",\

The first goal of this course is to provide a variety of experiences and activities with the aim of developing the creative abilities of each participant. A second goal is to understand the importance of creativity from a consumer perspective. Consumers are being offered more and more opportunities to customize their products and services, and are increasingly seeking to express their creativity through their purchasing choices. As entrepreneurs, we have the ability to shape the consumer environment in ways that help consumers enhance their own creative abilities, and develop a unique relationship with them as a result.\\n\\nThis course is aimed at anyone who wants to understand what we actually know (as opposed to what we think we know) about human creativity, and how to use this knowledge to think differently and productively about business challenges. As the focus is on creativity as a cognitive function, it does not matter what your background is, what industry you come from or want to enter.   \\n\\nAfter completing this course, past students report having acquired a set of strategies that enable them to tackle business problems with a fresh perspective.\\n\\nThis course is part of the HEC Paris MSc in Innovation and Entrepreneurship.

    "description": "La computaci\'f3n evolutiva (evolutionary computation, EC), aplica la teor\'eda de la evoluci\'f3n natural y la gen\'e9tica en la adaptaci\'f3n evolutiva de estructuras computacionales, proporcionando un medio alternativo para atacar problemas complejos en diversas \'e1reas, como la ingenier\'eda, econom\'eda, qu\'edmica, medicina y, porque no, las artes. Una poblaci\'f3n de posibles soluciones de un problema dado es an\'e1loga a una poblaci\'f3n de organismos vivos que evolucionan cada generaci\'f3n, al recombinar los mejores individuos de la poblaci\'f3n y transmitir sus caracter\'edsticas de dichos individuos padres, a sus descendientes. En este campo, diferentes esquemas de m\'e9todos evolutivos se han desarrollado, los cuales difieren en el tipo de estructuras que conforman la poblaci\'f3n.\\nAlgoritmos evolutivos (AE), como tambi\'e9n se le conoce al c\'f3mputo evolutivo (EC), se definen como m\'e9todos de optimizaci\'f3n y b\'fasqueda, los cuales est\'e1n inspirados y tratan de imitar de manera parcial los procesos de la evoluci\'f3n natural, y mantienen una poblaci\'f3n de estructuras que evolucionan de acuerdo a reglas de selecci\'f3n y otros operadores gen\'e9ticos, como cruzamiento y mutaci\'f3n (B\'e4ck, 1996).\\nLos algoritmos evolutivos no son los \'fanicos m\'e9todos de optimizaci\'f3n propuestos a partir de sistemas biol\'f3gicos. Se tiene una variedad de algoritmos de optimizaci\'f3n, que tratan de imitar el comportamiento de sistemas naturales, como las colonias de hormigas, algoritmos culturales y optimizaci\'f3n por c\'famulos de part\'edculas, entre otros. De aqu\'ed surge lo que se conoce como algoritmos bioinspirados, ya que toman sus bases a partir de la estructura de procesos y sistemas biol\'f3gicos: la evoluci\'f3n, la selecci\'f3n natural, comportamiento social de animales, como las hormigas, abejas, peces.\\n\\nB\'c4CK, T.

    "description": "Essentials of Global Health is a comprehensive introduction to global health. It is meant to introduce you to this topic in well-structured, clear and easy to understand ways. Much of the course will focus on five questions: What do people get sick, disabled and die from; Why do they suffer from these conditions? Which people are most affected? Why should we care about such concerns? What can be done to address key health issues, hopefully at least cost, as fast as possible, and in sustainable ways?  The course will be global in coverage but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, the health of the poor, and health disparities. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course to health systems issues, the linkages between health and development, and health matters related to global interdependence. The course will cover key concepts and frameworks but be practical in orientation.\\n\\nESSENTIALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F. SWENSEN FUND FOR INNOVATION IN TEACHING.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCourse Learning Objectives\\n\\nBy the end of the course, learners should be able to:\\n\\n\'95\\tArticulate key public health concepts related to global health;\\n\'95\\tAnalyze the key issues in global health from a number of perspectives;\\t\\n\'95\\tDiscuss with confidence the burden of disease in various regions of the world; how it varies by sex, age, and location; key risk factors for this burden; and how the disease burden can be addressed in cost-effective ways;\\n\'95\\tAssess key health disparities, especially as they relate to the health of low-income and marginalized people in low- and middle-income countries; \\n\'95\\tOutline the key actors and organizations in global health and the manner in which they cooperate to address critical global health concerns;\\n\'95\\tReview key global health challenges that are likely to arise in the coming decades.\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nValue Added of the Course\\n\\nThe course seeks to add special value by being comprehensive, by handling each  topic in a consistent framework, and by helping learners gain an understanding of well grounded approaches to assessing global health issues and what can be done to address them.\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Readings and other materials for Essentials of Global Health\\n\\nFor almost every session of Essentials of Global Health, you will see: \\n\\n- Required readings\\n- Recommended readings\\n- Recommended videos\\n\\nWe have selected a small number of readings for each session that are central to understanding the content of the session. We have put these under \'93required readings\'94.\\n\\nFor each required reading, we have also indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.\\n\\nIn addition, we have selected some additional readings that would be very helpful to your understanding the content of each session. \\n\\nThe first is a textbook, Global Health 101, third edition. This is a comprehensive introductory textbook that closely follows the content of this Essentials of Global Health course. We have indicated for each session what part of the book you should read. Using this textbook can be very valuable to your mastering the content of the course.\\n\\nThe second set of \'93recommended readings\'94 is some additional readings, mostly from journal articles and reports. For these, too, we have indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.\\n\\nLearners should note that to access articles from The Lancet they will have to register with the Lancet, if they do not have online access to a library that has The Lancet. Once they are registered, they will be able to sign into The Lancet and access all of its free articles.\\n\\nWe have also indicated for most sessions one or two videos that relate to the topic of the session. These are meant to help the learner get a better feel for the topic which is being covered. Most learners will find the videos brief, easy and enjoyable to watch, and very enlightening.",\

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism. In particular, you'll see how many familiar ideas from functional programming map perfectly to to the data parallel paradigm. We'll start the nuts and bolts how to effectively parallelize familiar collections operations, and we'll build up to parallel collections, a production-ready data parallel collections library available in the Scala standard library. Throughout, we'll apply these concepts through several hands-on examples that analyze real-world data, such as popular algorithms like k-means clustering.\\n\\nLearning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:\\n\\n- reason about task and data parallel programs,\\n- express common algorithms in a functional style and solve them in parallel,\\n- competently microbenchmark parallel code,\\n- write programs that effectively use parallel collections to achieve performance\\n\\nRecommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line.

We\'92ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.\\n\\nWhat you\'92ll need:\\nThis is a self-contained course: all the knowledge necessary to succeed in the course and build the computer system will be given as part of the learning experience. Therefore, we assume no previous computer science or engineering knowledge, and all learners are welcome aboard. You will need no physical materials, since you will build the computer on your own PC, using a software-based hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers in the field. The hardware simulator, as well as other software tools, will be supplied freely after you enroll in the course.\\n\\nCourse format:\\nThe course consists of six modules, each comprising a series of video lectures, and a project. You will need about 2-3 hours to watch each module's lectures, and about 5-10 hours to complete each one of the six projects. The course can be completed in six weeks, but you are welcome to take it at your own pace. You can watch a TED talk about this course by Googling \\"nand2tetris TED talk\\".\\n\\n*About Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts as you learn, you\'92ll master the course content more efficiently; you\'92ll also get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in your life and career. When you complete the course, you\'92ll have a finished project that you\'92ll be proud to use and share.",\

Throughout the live experience of excavation, with images taken on the field, this course will let you touch the many tesserae of the great mosaic of the Mediterranean Civilization. The field diary of the archaeologist, and the handpick will be the two tools, which will lead us across the sea to discover what such early cities actually were, and how their contribute is still a major part of our shared memory.",\

    "description": "We all learn numbers from the childhood. Some of us like to count, others hate it, but any person uses numbers everyday to buy things, pay for services, estimated time and necessary resources. People have been wondering about numbers\'92 properties for thousands of years. And for thousands of years it was more or less just a game that was only interesting for pure mathematicians. Famous 20th century mathematician G.H. Hardy once said \'93The Theory of Numbers has always been regarded as one of the most obviously useless branches of Pure Mathematics\'94. Just 30 years after his death, an algorithm for encryption of secret messages was developed using achievements of number theory. It was called RSA after the names of its authors, and its implementation is probably the most frequently used computer program in the word nowadays. Without it, nobody would be able to make secure payments over the internet, or even log in securely to e-mail and other personal services. In this short course, we will make the whole journey from the foundation to RSA in 4 weeks. By the end, you will be able to apply the basics of the number theory to encrypt and decrypt messages, and to break the code if one applies RSA carelessly. You will even pass a cryptographic quest!\\n\\nAs prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students.",\

    "description": "Globalization has brought dramatic changes to the marketplace. A proliferation of global brands brings diverse cultures to a consumer population that is also growing culturally diverse. This course enables students to understand how globalization changes consumers at a psychological level, and provides tools for imbuing brands with cultural meanings\'97creating iconic brands\'97that can resonate with global consumers. The focus is on understanding that culture exists in the mind (e.g., values and beliefs) as well as in the environment (e.g., objects, brands, and institutions), and that globalization creates multi-cultural spaces in contemporary societies. Consumers can use the cultural meaning of a brand to build their identities (i.e., assimilate the brand cultural symbolism) or reject the brand\'92s cultural meaning(s) (i.e., exclusionary reactions).\\n\\nThe course will help students identify when assimilation vs. exclusionary reactions are more likely to occur, as well as devise strategies for imbuing brands with cultural meanings that can elevate them to the status of cultural icons. \\n\\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\\n\'95\\tUnderstand how globalization impacts the psychological responses of consumers in global markets \\n\'95\\tUnderstand what culture is and how it manifests itself \\n\'95\\tUnderstand how brands acquire cultural meanings \\n\'95\\tPredict consumers\'92 responses to the cultural meanings in brands \\n\'95\\tIdentify strategies to win-over multi-cultural consumers in globalized markets \\n\'95\\tLearn how to build an iconic brand\\n\\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

    "description": "Welcome to the fifth and final course in the Cisco Networking Basics Specialization.\\n\\nIn the first four courses of this specialization, you were focused on understanding how computer networks work and how to access the network. Now that you have a firm grasp of how to build and secure a wireless home network, you will be introduced to the basics of adding Cisco routers and switches to networks that are typically deployed in small to medium sized businesses.  You will perform the basic setup and configuration steps needed to get switches and routers connected in a small network. You will also learn how to configure the router and the switch for remote access. You will use two different types of simulation tools to practice configuration steps. After completing required configuration tasks, you will use various show commands to verify configurations and use the ping command to verify basic connectivity between devices. Expect lots of opportunities for practicing Cisco device configuration. This course requires the use of Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate the network environment.  You will need to download and use Cisco Packet Tracer throughout the course.\\n\\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\\n\\n1. Describe the features and functions of various Cisco devices installed in a typical simple computer network.\\n2. Use the Packet Tracer simulation software to practice configuration tasks using the command line interface.\\n3.

    "description": "This course is for you if you are interested in transitioning toward a managerial role in cybersecurity and mobility. Through interviews with industry experts in this area, you will be able to analyze innovations powering the rapid spread of information technology and how they present new challenges for protecting data. For example, mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional security measures. After this course, you will be able to describe how the nature of the threat evolves, as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data exchange.\\n\\nIf you want to pursue a career in the public sector, the stakes are high as well. The proliferation of hackers, inevitable human errors, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives, and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh heavily on government and education organizations, and consume substantial resources. The Pentagon, for example, has proposed to spend $23 billion on network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum, until you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources this investment must protect.\\n\\nAfter completing the course modules you will be able to explain how yesterday\'92s prevention strategies are no longer adequate for stopping advanced, targeted attacks. Effective cybersecurity must be multi-dimensional and tiered, as threats can originate from virtually anywhere, target numerous levels of an organization, and sometimes persist for months or years before an information security staff is aware of an attack or breach. Therefore securing networks requires a holistic approach that incorporates several elements.",\

Personal life is enriched when these same skills are applied to problems in everyday life involving judgment and choice. This course presents basic concepts from statistics, probability, scientific methodology, cognitive psychology and cost-benefit theory and shows how they can be applied to everything from picking one product over another to critiquing media accounts of scientific research. Concepts are defined briefly and breezily and then applied to many examples drawn from business, the media and everyday life.\\n\\nWhat kinds of things will you learn? Why it\'92s usually a mistake to interview people for a job. Why it\'92s highly unlikely that, if your first meal in a new restaurant is excellent, you will find the next meal to be as good. Why economists regularly walk out of movies and leave restaurant food uneaten. Why getting your picture on the cover of Sports Illustrated usually means your next season is going to be a disappointment. Why you might not have a disease even though you\'92ve tested positive for it. Why you\'92re never going to know how coffee affects you unless you conduct an experiment in which you flip a coin to determine whether you will have coffee on a given day. Why it might be a mistake to use an office in a building you own as opposed to having your office in someone else\'92s building. Why you should never keep a stock that\'92s going down in hopes that it will go back up and prevent you from losing any of your initial investment.

    "description": "As health informaticists, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as\\n-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from\'a0our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare\'a0organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use.\'a0\\n\\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations.\'a0",\

    "description": "What is XR? It\'92s shorthand for a related set of new technologies that are changing the way we interact with the world and with each other: Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality.\\n \\nTo understand XR, you need to understand the technologies that enable it. If you understand the available technologies, how they are used, and what their future holds, you\'92ll be well equipped to deal with XR as it rapidly evolves and converges.\\n\\nIn this course, we will present an introduction to XR using a broadly chronological approach, focusing on how all of the underlying technologies came together at key moments in the history of XR to launch the concepts of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality into the mainstream consciousness. Throughout the course, we\'92ll give a brief description of each of the supporting technologies, some history about when it first came into use, limitations and future potential for improvement, and how it\'92s used for AR, VR, and MR.  \\n\\nAs you learn about the technology, you\'92ll also develop hands on experience in the field along two tracks. First, you will use Unity to build and run two simple XR applications on your own smartphone: a \'93VR Museum\'94 app and a handheld Augmented Reality app. Second, you will brainstorm, define, visualize, and iterate your own original concept for an XR application, ending the course with a thorough and peer-reviewed XR Product Brief that you could use as the basis for future development.\\n\\nThis is the first of three planned courses in Unity's XR Specialization, which include the Mobile VR App Development with Unity course as well as a future course focused on developing Augmented Reality (AR) applications with Unity.",\

    "description": "The Kotlin programming language is a modern language that gives you more power for your everyday tasks. Kotlin is concise, safe, pragmatic, and focused on interoperability with Java code. It can be used almost everywhere Java is used today: for server-side development, Android apps, and much more. Kotlin is 100% compatible with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling support. It\'92s a pragmatic language with a very low learning curve, and can be quickly grasped by Java developers. Kotlin code might be compiled not only to JVM bytecode but to JavaScript and Native code as well, but this course is focused on Kotlin/JVM.\\n\\nThis course aims to share with you the power and the beauty of Kotlin. We'll have a basic overview of the language, as well as a discussion of many corner cases, especially concerning Java interoperability. The course is based on your Java experience; it shows the similarities between the two languages and focuses on what's going to be different. \\nNote that this course won't cover the programming fundamentals. We'll discuss: basic syntax, nullability, functional programming with Kotlin, object-oriented programming with Kotlin, the power of the Kotlin standard library, and Java interoperability.",\

    "description": "Improving health care for veterans has become a matter of national attention and has gained increasing attention from the medical community.  With the current surge of veterans reintegrating into civilian society it is critical to improve the training of the next cadre of providers who will provide care for our veterans.  It is widely known that veterans receive care in all aspects of the health system, thus providers in  veteran focused care facilities, military health serves and civilian locals must be aware of the unique needs of veterans.  It is perhaps even more important to educate civilian providers who may be unfamiliar with the unique physical, mental and emotional needs related to military service.\\n\\nCourse Audience\\n - all health professions learners, example:\\n - medical students, resident physicians, dental students,\\n - nursing students, advanced practice nurses,\\n - social work, pharmacy student as graduate level learners\\n - as well as any and all health professionals interested in veteran-centered care\\n\\nWhat You Will Learn:\\nThis course will provide learners the opportunity to engage with material to facilitate their understanding of the origins of Academic Medical Centers and Veterans Administration affiliations, recognize and manage the influence of bias, class, and power on the clinical encounter and self-reflect on their biases that particularly affect U.S. military veterans.   This course also features several video clips from the acclaimed documentary, Where Soldiers Come From, directed by Heather Courtney.\\n\\n\\nThe views expressed in this course are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position or the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs or the U.S. government.",\
